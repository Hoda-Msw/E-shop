# E-shop
Electronic shopping system

The E-Shop consists of four modules; User Interface, Authentication, Account Management, Trade Management.
It is architected in a way similar to eBay. In this simple e-shop, each user can be a seller or buyer at the same time. Users can publish items to be sold or add items to their cart and finalize a purchase. In order for a user to make a purchase, he/she has to
have the purchase amount in the wallet.
